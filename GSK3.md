# Glycogen synthase kinase 3

Glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) has been found in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms. It is used by the Fungus, Animal, and Bacteria kingdoms.

# Finding the Structure
You can find the structure of the protein at this link: http://www.rcsb.org/structure/4E7W
The rcsb site also allows you to look at a 3-D version or check for sequence and structural similarity.
There are proteins available that have additional complexes with them, e.g. inhibitors

# Its purpose
GSK3 is an enzyme that aids in the metabolism of glycogen. It was later found to play an important part in cell division/mitosis. 
It has also been found in high density at the brain and been linked to certain neurological diseases.
