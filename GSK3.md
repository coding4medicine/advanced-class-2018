# Finding the Structure
You can find the structure of the protein at this link: http://www.rcsb.org/structure/4E7W
The rcsb site also allows you to look at a 3-D version or check for sequence and structural similarity.
There are proteins available that have additional complexes with them, e.g. inhibitors
